# Slides for Intelligent Systems
## Computer Engineering Degree by the University of Córdoba

PDF and Latex sources of the slides used for laboratory lessons of the course Intelligent Systems from the Computer Engineer Degree by the University of Córdoba, Spain. Slides are in Spanish.


# Requirements

This theme requires `xcolor` and `tikz` packages. For this reason, you have to begin your document with:
```TeX
\documentclass[usenames,dvipsnames]{beamer}
```
This is **mandatory** due to compatibility issues between these two packages and `beamer`.

# Acknowledgements

The Latex template used for the slides is based on the work of Marco Basaldella and his [unoficial template for the University of Udine](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/university-of-udine-unofficial-beamer-theme/zndkgxrjsdzt).
